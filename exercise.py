def exercise(code):
    r"""
    Use the %exercise cell decorator to create interactive exercise
    sets.  Put %exercise at the top of the cell, then write Sage code
    in the cell that defines the following (all are optional):

    - a ``question`` variable, as an HTML string with math in dollar
      signs

    - an ``answer`` variable, which can be any object, or a pair
      (correct_value, interact control) -- see the docstring for
      interact for controls.

    - an optional callable ``check(answer)`` that returns a boolean or
      a 2-tuple

            (True or False, message),

      where the first argument is True if the answer is correct, and
      the optional second argument is a message that should be
      displayed in response to the given answer.  NOTE: Often the
      input "answer" will be a string, so you may have to use Integer,
      RealNumber, or sage_eval to evaluate it, depending
      on what you want to allow the user to do.

    - hints -- optional list of strings to display in sequence each
      time the user enters a wrong answer.  The last string is
      displayed repeatedly.  If hints is omitted, the correct answer
      is displayed after three attempts.

    NOTE: The code that defines the exercise is executed so that it
    does not impact (and is not impacted by) the global scope of your
    variables elsewhere in your session.  Thus you can have many
    %exercise cells in a single worksheet with no interference between
    them.

    The following examples further illustrate how %exercise works.

    An exercise to test your ability to sum the first $n$ integers::

        %exercise
        title    = "Sum the first n integers, like Gauss did."
        n        = randint(3, 100)
        question = "What is the sum $1 + 2 + \\cdots + %s$ of the first %s positive integers?"%(n,n)
        answer   = n*(n+1)//2

    Transpose a matrix::

        %exercise
        title    = r"Transpose a $2 \times 2$ Matrix"
        A        = random_matrix(ZZ,2)
        question = "What is the transpose of $%s?$"%latex(A)
        answer   = A.transpose()

    Add together a few numbers::

        %exercise
        k        = randint(2,5)
        title    = "Add %s numbers"%k
        v        = [randint(1,10) for _ in range(k)]
        question = "What is the sum $%s$?"%(' + '.join([str(x) for x in v]))
        answer   = sum(v)

    The trace of a matrix::

        %exercise
        title    = "Compute the trace of a matrix."
        A        = random_matrix(ZZ, 3, x=-5, y = 5)^2
        question = "What is the trace of $$%s?$$"%latex(A)
        answer   = A.trace()

    Some basic arithmetic with hints and dynamic feedback::

        %exercise
        k        = randint(2,5)
        title    = "Add %s numbers"%k
        v        = [randint(1,10) for _ in range(k)]
        question = "What is the sum $%s$?"%(' + '.join([str(x) for x in v]))
        answer   = sum(v)
        hints    = ['This is basic arithmetic.', 'The sum is near %s.'%(answer+randint(1,5)), "The answer is %s."%answer]
        def check(attempt):
            c = Integer(attempt) - answer
            if c == 0:
                return True
            if abs(c) >= 10:
                return False, "Gees -- not even close!"
            if c < 0:
                return False, "too low"

                return False, "too high"
