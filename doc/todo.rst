The next phase
==============

Security
--------
* (Alex K.) Implement untrusted account restrictions:

  * explore SELinux or some other solution for untrusted users (like LXC):
    http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/13/html/Security-Enhanced_Linux/sect-Security-Enhanced_Linux-Targeted_Policy-Confined_and_Unconfined_Users.html,
    http://selinux-mac.blogspot.com/2009/06/selinux-lockdown-part-four-customized.html,
    http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/selinux/selinux-handbook.xml, http://debian-handbook.info/browse/wheezy/sect.selinux.html
  * see also Linux containers: http://www.docker.io/, http://pyvideo.org/video/1852/the-future-of-linux-containers.  see also http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-lxc-security/
  * have a pool of user accounts to execute code in.  Have the forking kernel manager drop privileges when forking and switch users to an unused user account, then clean up any files by the user when the computation is done. (see https://github.com/sagemath/sagecell/issues/233)
  * Here's another crazy idea for managing diskspace: per-process filesystem namespaces (like http://glandium.org/blog/?p=217) along with copy-on-write unionfs mounts.  When a sage process is done, just throw away the unionfs mount, and poof, everything is gone.  See also http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-mount-namespaces/index.html or http://blog.endpoint.com/2012/01/linux-unshare-m-for-per-process-private.html and the bottom of http://linux.die.net/man/2/mount
* Manage daemons without screen (using https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-daemon/, maybe?  Or maybe http://www.jejik.com/articles/2007/02/a_simple_unix_linux_daemon_in_python/ ?  See also http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3143/ ). (see https://github.com/sagemath/sagecell/issues/253 and https://github.com/sagemath/sagecell/issues/120)

Codebase
--------
* (Joel) implement cookie-based TOS agreement, activated on evaluating your first computation (necessary for hosting at UW)
* Change output model so that output of a request can be confined, and
  the browser knows where the output goes (instead of just trusting
  the python side to send an output id).  This would help with displaying errors, for example. (see https://github.com/sagemath/sagecell/issues/387)
* Automatically expire and restart idle workers.  See https://github.com/sagemath/sagecell/issues/391

Permalink database
------------------
* Either implement database mirroring or use a server that does, deploy multiple permalink servers.  Possibilities for a database server include:

  * web side in Tornado, Go, or Node.js (for many simultaneous connections, but I suppose we could go back to flask/wsgi or something of that nature too)
  * database side in PostgreSQL (with propogation), Redis, Couchbase, Cassandra (Cassandra seems to fit the distributed, no-single-point-of-failure need)
  * Another possibility is to do the permalink server as a simple Google App Engine project.  William has lots of credit for this sort of thing.
* logging of all requests (separate from permalinks): 
  * python logging facility (load-test this)
  * straight to append-only file
  * to database?

Lower priority
==============

Interacts
---------
* Port over William's interact implementation


* Implement William's exercise decorator

* control API:
  - all we really need is an event system in place.   A way for
    controls to invoke python callbacks

* look into putting output in iframe to avoid all of the styling
  issues we've dealt with
* Set up dependency management on python side: control updates are sent immediately on variable assignment.  This also allows us to easily track which controls got updated so they update only once, if wanted
* explore javascript widgets
* explore using bootstrap to lay out widgets (see William's design)
* implement an html layout

Slider('x+y') -> 

@interact
def update(slider):
     pass
register an update f.slider = x+y when x is changed
register an update f.slider = x+y when y is changed

@interact
class interact:
    update function

    set function


vs. my way:

Slider('x+y') -> 

the widget knows how to parse string expressions, and registers itself for updates.  It can also have a setting method

With my way, updating a slider calls just the slider update function.  Williams way, updating a slider calls the whole control group update function

With my way, the grouped variables are stored in an interactive namespace.  William's they are implicitly stored as locals of a function.   William's way is more implicit.


Summer Projects
===============
* new interacts, maybe based on William's system
* string decorators
* get sagecell patches into Sage
* Configure and deploy CentOS images using SELinux, a cloud database,
  and nginx for static assets.  Kernels should be tied to different
  users.  Rate limits and request logging should be in place.  All
  things should be proper daemons with appropriate watchdog processes.
  * Virtual image
    [X] sagecell server
    [X] sage worker account and ssh setup
    [X] tar up sage install so installing it doesn't involve recompiling
    [X] Make temporary directory writable by both the worker and the server (maybe just group-writeable)
    [X] sage cell config
    [X] Figure out permissions so that sageworker can execute sage
    [X] Set up http port forward
    [X] snapshots so I don't have to reinstall every single time.  Figure out how to make an image that is based on a single base image
    [X] Figure out appropriate firewall rules (lokkit --disabled to disable firewall)
    [X] permanent and temporary disks for database and tmp (leave tmp
        alone, just mount permanent disk)
    [X] diagnose and fix network problem when cloning:
        http://adam.younglogic.com/2010/06/eth0-not-present-after-libvirt-clone/,
        http://crashmag.net/correcting-the-eth0-mac-address-in-rhel-or-centos,
        https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=756130,
        We now delete the hardcoded mac address, and then delete the automatic generation of the eth0 rules.
    [X] quotas
    [X] immutable .ssh, .sage, etc. for sage worker
    [X] clean tmp directory (added cron script using tmpwatch)
    [X] use systemd or some other service to keep the cell server up
        - Final solution: use systemd and a cron script that checks
          every 2 minutes to make sure the website is still up.  This
          is way less complicated than monit, at the cost of a
          possible 2-minute downtime for a server.  If the server
          crashes, it is immediately restarted.  We could make the
          polling interval smaller.
    [X] Nginx -- installed and haproxy points to it
    [ ] Figure out better(?) database solution.
        - benchmark the current tornado/sqlite permalink server solution.
        - estimate the load we expect
        - examine postgresql, couchbase, and cassandra for backend
        - examine node, go, tornado for front end
        - build centos-derived shadow vm for db server, probably
          separate from sagecell exec servers
    [ ] Test taking down a server; do clients automatically redirect
        to other servers?  It seems that I wasn't being redirected
        this last week when the server I was talking to went down
    [ ] Add google analytics code to the sage cell root page 
    [ ] Better logging: log for web *and* service: where computations are coming from,
          compute code
        - log to permalink server (requests made from server, so
          should be fast; this means that logs are stored offsite from the untrusted images)
          we could also just use a remote logging service; centos comes with nice logging: http://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=CentOS_6&p=rsyslog, http://blog.secaserver.com/2013/01/centos-6-install-remote-logging-server-rsyslog/ (log with python logging module: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3968669/how-to-configure-logging-to-syslog-in-python), http://help.papertrailapp.com/kb/configuration/configuring-centralized-logging-from-python-apps
        - make logging address configurable from the config file?
        - log:
           - where computations are coming from (embedding page URL or
             requesting IP address if /service)
           - type of computation (/service or normal evaluate; should
             we also track interact changes?)
           - date/time
           - kernel id (this will track separate computations)
           - code executed
    [ ] Make ssh more secure: http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Network/SecuringSSH
    [ ] Polyinstantiated directories: https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Security-Enhanced_Linux/polyinstantiated-directories.html
    [ ] use selinux: http://magazine.redhat.com/2008/04/17/fedora-9-and-summit-preview-confining-the-user-with-selinux/ http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SELinux  http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Security_Guide/index.html http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Security_Guide/index.html
    [X] Set up centos servers on combinat
    [X] Set up test servers
    [ ] Benchmark test servers
Currently:
   * make-image: make an initial centos.img image
   * make-clone: make a sagecell.img clone
   * build-sage.sh sage-5.9-built.tar: build sage on the sagecell VM


  * rate limiting for incoming computations and permalink requests, both total and by IP
    * HAProxy (upgrade to 1.5dev): http://blog.serverfault.com/2010/08/26/1016491873/ or http://blog.exceliance.fr/2012/02/27/use-a-load-balancer-as-a-first-row-of-defense-against-ddos/ or https://code.google.com/p/haproxy-docs/wiki/rate_limit_sessions
    * iptables: http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/187 or http://penguinsecurity.net/wiki/index.php?title=The_iptables_Rate-Limiting_Module (for example)
  * load testing (ab, httperf, jmeter, our own multimechanize solution)
  * pool of user accounts in which code is executed
