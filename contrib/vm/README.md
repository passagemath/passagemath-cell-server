# Advanced Installation

Here we describe how to setup a "production" instance of SageMathCell server.

## Create the "Enveloping Virtual Machine" (EVM).

This is optional, if you are willing to dedicate a physical machine to SageMathCell. In any case **/var/lib/lxc must be a BTRFS system on an SSD.**

It does not really matter how you create it. It is up to you also what resources you allocate to it. But something like 4 CPU cores, 32 GB RAM, and 200 GB SSD is a good starting point.

**The automating scripts are NOT TESTED SINCE 2018.** Adjust them to current versions and your needs or use them just as a guidance, if desired.

1.  Configure a package proxy, e.g. Apt-Cacher NG, for the machine that will host EVM.
2.  Install KVM and configure it for your account, consult your OS documentation as necessary.
3.  Download `build_host.sh` and `preseed.host` to some directory, that will be used also for the login script and SSH keys.

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/scevm
    cd ~/scevm
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sagemath/sagecell/master/contrib/vm/build_host.sh
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sagemath/sagecell/master/contrib/vm/preseed.host
    chmod a+x build_host.sh
    ```

4.  Make adjustments to `build_host.sh`, in particular the proxy and EVM resources.
5.  Make adjustments to `preseed.host` if desired, e.g. change time zone and locale settings.
6.  Run `build_host.sh` and wait: the installation make take half an hour or even longer with a slow Internet connection. Your terminal settings may get messed up in the process since we do not suppress the installation console, it will not happen after installation.

    ```bash
    ./build_host.sh
    ```

    (If your `virt-install` does not understand `OSVARIANT=ubuntu18.04`, you may try a different version of Ubuntu here, while keeping the same `LOCATION`, `osinfo-query os` may be useful. Using a different base OS is probably possible, but will likely require further changes to build commands.)

7.  You should get `ssh_host.sh` script that allows you to SSH as root to EVM. If it does not work, you probably need to adjust the IP address in it manually. Note that root password is disabled, you must use the SSH key generated during installation.

    ```bash
    ./ssh_host.sh
    ```

## Inside of EVM

1.  Download `container_manager.py` and make it executable (or run it with python3).

    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sagemath/sagecell/master/contrib/vm/container_manager.py
    chmod a+x container_manager.py
    ```

2.  Adjust it if necessary. In particular, note that the default permalink database server is the public one.
3.  Run it. The first time it adjusts system configuration and asks you to finish your session and start a new one. Then the base OS and the master SageMathCell container will be created. Expect it to take at least an hour.

    ```bash
    ./container_manager.py
    exit
    ./ssh_host.sh
    ./container_manager.py
    ```

4.  To create several compute nodes behind a load balancer, run

    ```bash
    ./container_manager.py --deploy
    ```

## Outside of EVM

1.  Configure HTTP and/or HTTPS access to EVM:80. HTTPS has to be decrypted before EVM, but it is recommended to avoid certain connection problems. If you are using HA-Proxy, you can add the following sections to `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.conf`:
 
    ```
    frontend http
        bind *:80
        bind *:443 ssl crt /etc/haproxy/cert/your_cerificate.pem
        option forwardfor
        http-request add-header X-Proto https if { ssl_fc }
        use_backend sagemathcell
        
    backend sagemathcell
        server sagemathcell_evm sagemathcell_evm_ip_address:80 check        
    ```

    If you are using Apache, a possible proxy configuration (with `proxy_wstunnel` module enabled) is
    
    ```
    ProxyPass /sockjs/info http://sagemathcell_evm_ip_address:80/sockjs/info
    ProxyPass /sockjs/ ws://sagemathcell_evm_ip_address:80/sockjs/
    ProxyPass / http://sagemathcell_evm_ip_address:80/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://sagemathcell_evm_ip_address:80/
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ```
    
2.  Configure (restricted) access to EVM:8888 for testing newer versions of SageMathCell.
3.  Configure (restricted) access to EVM:9999 for HA-Proxy statistics page.
4.  If you are going to run multiple EVMs, consider adjusting `/etc/rsyslog.d/sagecell.conf` in them to collect all logs on a single server.

## Maintenance Notes

1.  Used GitHub repositories are cached in `/root/github/` to reduce download size for upgrades.
2.  EVM is configured to install security updates automatically.
3.  Master containers are always fully updated before cloning deployment nodes.
4.  Deployment nodes are configured to install security updates automatically.
5.  EVM, deployment, and test containers should start automatically after reboot of the host machine.
  
## Upgrading

1.  Check if you have any custom changes to `container_manager.py` and save them in a patch:

    ```bash
    diff -u github/sagecell/contrib/vm/container_manager.py container_manager.py
    diff -u github/sagecell/contrib/vm/container_manager.py container_manager.py > local.patch
    ```

2. Pull the latest branch to your saved repository and look over changes:

    ```bash
    cd github/sagecell/ && git pull && cd && diff -u container_manager.py github/sagecell/contrib/vm/container_manager.py
    ```

3. If everything looks OK to you, apply your patch over new version of the script:

    ```bash
    cp github/sagecell/contrib/vm/container_manager.py . && patch container_manager.py local.patch
    ```

4.  Build new versions of all containers and deploy:

    ```bash
    ./container_manager.py -b -s -p -m --deploy
    ```

    Note that after the new version is started, the script will wait for a couple hours to make sure that users in the middle of interacting with the old one have finished their work.
5. If you want to first test the new version while keeping the old one in production, run instead

    ```bash
    ./container_manager.py -b -s -p -m -t
    ```

    and once you are satisfied with it
    
    ```bash
    ./container_manager.py --deploy
    ```
    
6. If you know that only some changes to SageMathCell source code were made, you can skip building Sage and its packages from scratch: `./container_manager.py -m`
7. For some other options check the built-in help: `./container_manager.py -h`
